## Introduction

The goal of this coursework is to develop a Python application for converting between Roman and Decimal numbers. The application serves as a tool for users to seamlessly convert numbers between these two numeral systems. To run the program, ensure Python is installed on your system, then execute the `converter.py` script. Using the program involves choosing the conversion type (Roman to Decimal or Decimal to Roman) and providing the input accordingly.

## Body/Analysis

The program implements the Roman-Decimal conversion functionalities using object-oriented programming principles and design patterns. Below are the key aspects of the implementation:

- **Object-Oriented Programming Pillars**: The program incorporates all four pillars of OOP, including polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- **Design Pattern**: The Factory Method design pattern is utilized to dynamically create converter objects based on the specified conversion type.
- **Unit Tests**: Core functionalities are covered with unit tests using the `unittest` framework, ensuring the correctness of the conversion logic.

Code snippets from the program are provided to illustrate the implementation of the requirements.

## Results

- The program successfully implements conversion logic for both Roman to Decimal and Decimal to Roman functionalities.
- Challenges faced during implementation primarily revolved around ensuring accurate conversion logic, handling edge cases, and maintaining adherence to PEP8 style guidelines.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, this coursework project has achieved its objectives of developing a robust Roman-Decimal converter in Python. The program demonstrates effective utilization of object-oriented programming principles and design patterns, ensuring modularity and extensibility. Future prospects include potential enhancements such as adding support for additional numeral systems, optimizing conversion algorithms further, and expanding unit test coverage.
